#Obstacle pathloss file. Naming: obstacle_loss.txt
#Place this file in "workspace/bin/bin_x64" folder of NetSim
#The format of this file is
#1st parameter - ENB ID
#2nd parameter - UE ID
#3rd parameter â€“ Obstacle pathloss in dB (A positive loss value which implies a negative gain)
#This obstacle pathloss will get added to the regular pathloss thereby
#reducing the signal power at receiver
#Ex: To set an obstacle pathloss of 5dB between 1 to 2 you have to set it 
$ENB_ID = 2 UE_ID = 3 PL_dB = 50
$ENB_ID = 2 UE_ID = 6 PL_dB = 50
